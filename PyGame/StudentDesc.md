# Game Development with Pygame
Learn how to use [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) to build a simple top-down game in Python. Start with by playing a game in the **Pygame Warm-up**. Next, review the **Pygame PowerPoint Presentation** and complete the **Top-Down Game Code-Along Activity**. Once that's done, work on the **Pygame Challenges**.

## Pygame Warm-up
Play the game linked from [this page](PygameWarmup.md) to see some of what is possible with Pygame.

## Top-Down Game Code-Along Activity
Follow the instructions on [this page](TopDownCodeAlong.md) to create a basic tile-based top-down game in Pygame.

## Pygame Challenges
Once the code-along activity has been completed, go to [this page](PygameChallenges.md) to start working on the challenges. Feel free to create anything, as long as it uses Pygame.

This lesson introduces a variety of core programming concepts in the context of Python. It is expected that students will already be proficient in the concepts; the goal is to translate their knowledge into the world of Python.

## Topics
This lesson covers the following topics:

- Variables
- Data Types
- Input/Output
- Conditional Statements
- While Loops
- Functions

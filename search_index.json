Applying the same concepts in multiple languages will help you reinforce your mastery of those concepts, and make it much easier for you to learn new languages in the future. Python is generally less verbose than a lot of other languages, and there are so many things you can do with very few lines of code. Python is also very popular for industry and personal projects.\nPoints\nEarn points throughout the semester by asking good questions, answering questions, helping others, working hard, and behaving well!\nViewing Point Totals\nCheck out this guide for viewing point totals in ClassDojo.\nRewards\nPoints can be redeemed for a variety of rewards.\n\n\n\nPoints\nReward\n\n\n\n\n3\nPlay a short online game with an instructor (e.g. Connect 4, Chess)\n\n\n5\nAdd an appropriate song to the class playlist\n\n\n5\nAn instructor will show you their pet\n\n\n10\nChoose an appropriate (\n\n\n15\nChoose an appropriate (\n\n\n20\nGet one of Juliette's Humble Bundle games\n\n\n25\nPlay a game as a class (e.g. skribbl.io)\n\n\n\n"},"ReplSetup.html":{"url":"ReplSetup.html","title":"Repl Setup","keywords":"","body":"Repl Setup for Python\nCreate a repl.it account in order to save and share Python projects.\n\nClick the \"Start coding\" button on repl.it \nFill out a username, email, and password, and click the \"Sign up\" button \nIf necessary, prove your humanity to verify the account\nOpen your email, and click the \"Complete Verification\" link \nOn your repls page, click the \"+ New repl\" button \nSelect \"Python\" from the Language list\nEnter a name for the Repl, like \"HelloWorld\"\nClick the \"Create repl\" button to create the new project! \n\nRepl.it Overview\nrepl.it is a website that allows developers to write and run code right from a web browser!\n\n\nCode Editor - This is where developers write code\nRun Button - Developers click this button to execute the code\nRun Area - This is where the developer sees the results of the code\n\nIn the new Repl, click the \"Run\" button to see the code execute.

Review the Introductory PowerPoint Presentation below. Then, complete the Turtle Code-Along Activity. Once that's done, work on the Turtle Challenges.\nIntroductory PowerPoint Presentation\n\n\nTurtle Code-Along Activity\nFollow the instructions on this page to create a simple Python program that draws on the screen.\nTurtle Challenges\nOnce the code-along activity has been completed, go to this page to start working on the challenges.\n"},"HelloPython/TurtleCodeAlong.html":{"url":"HelloPython/TurtleCodeAlong.html","title":"Turtle Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"Turtle Code-Along\nIn this introductory activity, use turtle graphics to create a drawing in Python!\n\nGetting Started\nSetup using repl.it is fairly simple.\n\nGo to the TurtleStart repl.it project\nFork the project, and make sure to log in!\nIn the code section, add the following line to import everything from the turtle library: from turtle import *\n\n\nClick the green Run button, and notice that nothing happens yet\nMake a new line under the import, and add the following code: shelly = Turtle()\n\n\nshelly is now a Turtle object - but Shelly needs a shape! Under that line, add the following code to give Shelly a shape:   shelly.shape(\"arrow\")\n\n\nRun the code again to see Shelly appear on the screen!\nBONUS: Update the code so that instead of an \"arrow\" shape, the turtle looks like a turtle\n\nCode\nfrom turtle import *\n\nshelly = Turtle()\nshelly.shape(\"arrow\")\n\nAdding Color\nMake things a little more interesting by updating the colors.\n\nMake a new line, and add code to change Shelly's color\nHINT: this is a lot like how the shape was updated - just using color instead\n\n\nOn the next line, add the following code: paper = shelly.getscreen()\n\n\nNow, the paper variable stores the screen. Change its color using bgcolor\nBONUS: Play around with the settings to create a pleasing (or terrible) color scheme!\n\nCode\nshelly.color(\"maroon\")\npaper = shelly.getscreen()\npaper.bgcolor(\"gold\")\n\nMore Colors\nAlthough there are many built-in colors, sometimes it is necessary to find a very specific color. In addition to using color names (like \"red\", \"orange\", etc), turtles can take color values in RGB format! The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. Basically, it is possible to create any digital color with a combination of red, green, and blue!\nEach color (R, G, and B) can take a number from 0 to 255. This represents the amount of the color in the mix. For example, a color with a Red value of 255, a Green value of 0, and a Blue value of 0 would be red.\nTry to guess how the following colors would look:\n\nRed 255, Green 0, Blue 255\nRed 255, Green 255, Blue 0\nRed 0, Green 0, Blue 255\nRed 255, Green 255, Blue 255\nRed 0, Green 0, Blue 0\nRed 255, Green 128, Blue 0\n\nThe combinations are almost endless! Google has a built-in color picker that developers and designers can utilize to find the perfect color. It displays RGB colors in this format:\nrgb(92, 144, 66)\nTo translate that into Python code, do the following:\nshelly.color(92, 144, 66)\n\nThis will set the color of the turtle to a dark green. The RGB method allows for much more specific colors, so developers can use precisely the color they need!\nMoving the Turtle\nOne of the most useful turtle abilities is the ability to move across the screen and draw like a pen! Create a blank line, and then add the following command on the next line:\nshelly.forward(50)\n\nClick the Run button to see the turtle move across the screen! Specifically, it moves forward 50 pixels in the direction it is currently facing (90 degrees).\nIt is also possible to turn the turtle. Add the following command on the next line:\nshelly.right(90)\n\nThis command turns the turtle 90 degrees to the right. Previously the direction of the turtle was 90 degrees (pointing to the right), so after turning 90 degrees to the right, the turtle should face down (180 degrees).\nRun the program again to see the turtle move to the right, then turn to face down!\nDrawing a Square\nAdd the following commands to the file, under the existing commands:\nshelly.forward(50)\nshelly.right(90)\nshelly.forward(50)\nshelly.right(90)\n\nRun the program to see what this code does. It should draw part of a square! How does that work? On a piece of paper, or on a whiteboard, try to draw the same square as the turtle:\n\nDraw the top side from left to right\nTurn the writing utensil and draw the right side from top to bottom\nTurn the writing utensil and draw the bottom side from left to right\n\nSo, the turtle moves 50 pixels to the right, turns 90 degrees to face down, moves 50 pixels down, turns 90 degrees to face left, moves 50 pixels to the left, and then turns 90 degrees to face up!\nBONUS\nTry to complete the square that Shelly is drawing.\nAnother Turtle\nUnder the existing code, add code to make a new turtle:\ncrush = Turtle()\ncrush.shape(\"turtle\")\ncrush.color(\"white\")\n\nThis new turtle will be completely separate from the other one. Instead of drawing a square, it will draw a circle.\nAdd the following code to draw a half circle:\ncrush.circle(50, 180)\n\nIn the example, the radius of the circle will be 50, and it will complete a 180 degree rotation.\nBONUS: instead of a half circle, draw a full circle!\nA New Starting Point\nCurrently, the two turtles are kind of on top of each other. Fix this by adding a new starting point for the crush turtle.\nBefore the commands that make crush draw the circle, add the following command:\ncrush.setpos(-100, 100)\n\nRun the program to see what happens. Crush moves, but there is another issue now!\nRemoving the Extra Pen Marks\nWhen Crush moves to the starting point, the pen draws an extra line! Instead of doing this, the program should lift up the pen before this movement.\nWhen working with turtles, it is possible to control whether the pen is \"up\" or \"down\" (like real life drawing). Before the crush.setpos command, add the following command:\ncrush.penup()\n\nThis will allow Crush to move without drawing anything! Run the program to see what happens.\nPutting the Pen Back Down\nOh no! After lifting up the pen, Crush no longer draws the triangle! Fix this by adding the following command after the crush.setpos command:\ncrush.pendown()\n\nThis way, Crush will pick up the pen when moving to the starting point, and then put it back down before moving in the triangular fashion.

The computer's move should be chosen randomly. Using a Python library, it will be possible to generate a random choice from a set of options (\"R\", \"P\", and \"S\").\n\nAt the top of the file, use import random to import the random library into the program\nThis provides a random object with a choice function\n\n\nUnder where the player_move is selected, create a new variable named computer_move\nSet the computer_move variable to be random.choice(\"RPS\")\nThis will choose either \"R\", \"P\", or \"S\" at random\n\n\n\nThe code should look something like this:\nimport random\n\nprint(\"Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!\")\nplayer_move = input(\"Enter R, P, or S: \")\n\ncomputer_move = random.choice(\"RPS\")\n\nBasic Battling\nNow the player has a move, and the computer has a move... but which will win? Take a look at this table for a refresher on the rules of Rock Paper Scissors:\n\nIn total, there are 9 possible outcomes. That's quite a lot, so instead of trying to code all 9, start with that first row.\nThere are three options:\n\nPlayer chooses rock, Computer chooses rock → tie\nPlayer chooses rock, Computer chooses paper → loss\nPlayer chooses rock, Computer chooses scissors → win\n\nThese all start the same: player chooses rock. That is the first condition for each of these outcomes. In the code, under the computer_move line, create an if statement that checks if the player chose rock:\nif player_move == \"R\":\n\nAnd what should happen if the player chooses rock? Well, it depends on what the computer chose!\nRock v. Rock\nSay the computer chose rock as well. That would be the next condition, still within the scope of this first condition:\nif player_move == \"R\":\n    if computer_move == \"R\":\n\nNow, in the block within the second condition, it is known that the player chose rock, AND the computer chose rock. And what should happen in that case? It will be a tie! Print out a message saying as much.\nif player_move == \"R\":\n    if computer_move == \"R\":\n        print(\"Rock v. Rock: Tie\")\n\nRun the program, enter \"R\", and see what happens. It should only print something if the computer chooses rock.\nRock v. Paper\nAdd code to handle the case when the computer chooses paper (after the player chose rock). This should be within the block of player_move == \"R\", under the computer_move == \"R\" statement.\n\nAdd an elif checking if the computer chose paper (indented 1 level)\nWithin that new elif block, create a print statement (indented 2 levels)\nAdd the result - \"Rock v. Paper: Computer Wins\"\n\nRock v. Scissors\nAdd code to handle the case when the computer chooses scissors (after the player chose rock). This should, again, be within the block of player_move == \"R\", under the computer_move == \"R\" statement.\n\nAdd an elif checking if the computer chose scissors (indented 1 level)\nWithin that new elif block, create a print statement (indented 2 levels)\nAdd the result - \"Rock v. Scissors: Player Wins\"\n\nTesting the Code\nAt this point, the if statement should look something like this:\nif player_move == \"R\":\n    if computer_move == \"R\":\n        print(\"Rock v. Rock: Tie\")\n    elif computer_move == \"P\":\n        print(\"Rock v. Paper: Computer Wins\")\n    elif computer_move == \"S\":\n        print(\"Rock v. Scissors: Player Wins\")\n\nRun the program, and make sure that all outcomes are possible to reach. They should occur with approximately equal frequency.\nA Battling Function\nSo far, the program is working, but it is becoming a little unwieldy. Before adding in the other outcomes, define a function to handle the battling outcomes to clear up the main game code.\n\nRight under the import random statement, create some space in the code\nDefine a new function named battle\nThe function should take in a player parameter (for the player's move)\nThe function should also take in a computer parameter (for the computer's move)\n\n\nCopy the big if statement, and paste it into the body of the battle function\nMake sure it is indented one extra level under the definition line\n\n\nChange computer_move and player_move to computer and player (respectively)\n\nThe function definition should look like this:\ndef battle(player, computer):\n    if player == \"R\":\n        if computer == \"R\":\n            print(\"Rock v. Rock: Tie\")\n        elif computer == \"P\":\n            print(\"Rock v. Paper: Computer Wins\")\n        elif computer == \"S\":\n            print(\"Rock v. Scissors: Player Wins\")\n\nNow, all that's left is to call the battle function! Call it at the bottom of the file, passing in the player_move and computer_move values.\nbattle(player_move, computer_move)\n\nRun the code, and verify that it behaves in the same way. This was an example of refactoring; the code changed, but the functionality stayed the same.\nAll Battle Results\nThe next step is to modify the battle function to include all possible results. There are 6 remaining results to add:\n\nPlayer chooses Paper:\nComputer chooses Rock: Win\nComputer chooses Paper: Tie\nComputer chooses Scissors: Loss\n\n\nPlayer chooses Scissors:\nComputer chooses Rock: Loss\nComputer chooses Paper: Win\nComputer chooses Scissors: Tie\n\n\n\nHandle each outcome in the battle function.\n\nUnder the if, add an elif checking if the player selected paper\nIndented one additional level, check the three computer options\nPrint the result for each outcome\nUnder the player paper elif, check if the player selected scissors\nAgain indented one level under, check the three computer options\nPrint the results for each outcome\n\nThe code added code should look something like this:\nelif player == \"P\":\n    if computer == \"R\":\n        print(\"Paper v. Rock: Player Wins\")\n    elif computer == \"P\":\n        print(\"Paper v. Paper: Tie\")\n    elif computer == \"S\":\n        print(\"Paper v. Scissors: Computer Wins\")\nelif player == \"S\":\n    if computer == \"R\":\n        print(\"Scissors v. Rock: Computer Wins\")\n    elif computer == \"P\":\n        print(\"Scissors v. Paper: Player Wins\")\n    elif computer == \"S\":\n        print(\"Scissors v. Scissors: Tie\")\n\nRun the program a few more times, and test out the different paths! Try to reach every outcome.\nGame Loop\nNow the game is complete, but it would be nice if rematches were a little easier. Create a game loop that will allow the player to play again as often as desired.\n\nAbove the \"Welcome\" message, create a new variable named playing\nSet the playing variable to equal \"y\"\nUnder that, create a while loop that will continue as long as playing is equal to \"y\"\nIndent the main game code, so that it is within the while loop code block\nFind the bottom of the while loop block, still within the same scope\nCreate an input statement asking \"Would you like to play again (y/n)? \"\nSet the playing variable to be the result of the input\n\nThe code should look something like this:\nplaying = \"y\"\nwhile playing == \"y\":\n    print(\"Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors!\")\n\n    player_move = input(\"Enter R, P, or S: \")\n    computer_move = random.choice(\"RPS\")\n\n    battle(player_move, computer_move)\n\n    playing = input(\"Would you like to play again (y/n)? \")\n\nRun the program, and make sure it is possible to play multiple times!\nFinal Code\nimport random\n\ndef battle(player, computer):\n    if player == \"R\":\n        if computer == \"R\":\n            print(\"Rock v. Rock: Tie\")\n        elif computer == \"P\":\n            print(\"Rock v. Paper: Computer Wins\")\n        elif computer == \"S\":\n            print(\"Rock v. Scissors: Player Wins\")\n    elif player == \"P\":\n        if computer == \"R\":\n            print(\"Paper v. Rock: Player Wins\")\n        elif computer == \"P\":\n            print(\"Paper v. Paper: Tie\")\n        elif computer == \"S\":\n            print(\"Paper v. Scissors: Computer Wins\")\n    elif player == \"S\":\n        if computer == \"R\":\n            print(\"Scissors v. Rock: Computer Wins\")\n        elif computer == \"P\":\n            print(\"Scissors v. Paper: Player Wins\")\n        elif computer == \"S\":\n            print(\"Scissors v.

Test the program and make sure that all outcomes are reachable.\n\nBug 1\nBug 2\nBug 3\nBug 4\n\n1. Nicer Printing\nWhile the program should be functional after the code-along, it does not have the best user experience. Update the code to make it a little easier to read for the user.\n\nAdd an empty print statement under the \"Welcome\" message to make a new line under it\nAdd another empty print statement above the final input in the while block\nAdd another empty print statement at the bottom of the while block\nAdd print statements above and below the battle output, adding a \"box\" using dashes\n\nRun the program, and make sure it is a little more usable!\nBONUS: ASCII Art\nASCII art is a graphic design technique that creates images from text characters. Utilize some ASCII art to make the program more exciting!\nIn Python, it is possible to create multiline strings, which can make ASCII art much easier. Instead of using a single double quote ( \" ) to start and end a string, use three double quotes ( \"\"\" ).\nFor example, this code:\nvalue = \"\"\"this is a \nmultiline\nstring\"\"\"\nprint(value)\n\nwill print this:\nthis is a \nmultiline\nstring\nAn example of art for Rock Paper Scissors can be found here: https://gist.github.com/wynand1004/b5c521ea8392e9c6bfe101b025c39abe\n2. Handling Invalid Input\nAt the moment, the program works if the user enters \"R\", \"P\", or \"S\". However, if the player enters anything else, no message is displayed. Make some updates so that this is properly handled.\n\nIn the battle function, find the bottom of the block\nAt the same level as the first if, add an else: clause\nIn the else block, print a message saying \"Invalid Selection\"\n\nRun the program, and verify that invalid input sees a proper response!\nBONUS: Boxify Valid Battle\nAs it is, the \"Invalid Selection\" will display in the same \"box\" as the battle statement. Update the code so that the \"box\" dashes only appear for a legitimate battle.\n3. Tracking Score\nThis challenge is a little more difficult. One nice feature for the program would be the ability to track a player's wins across multiple games.\n\nFind the battle function definition\nFind each print statement where the player wins\nUnder each of those statements, with the same indentation level, add return True\nThis True indicates that the player won the battle\n\n\nFor each other print statement, add return False directly beneath\nAbove the while loop, create a new variable named score\nSet the value of the score variable to 0\nWithin the while loop, find the battle function call\nSet the result of the battle call to a new variable: won\nUnder the battle call, create an if statement\nMake the if statement check if won is True\nIn the block of the if statement, increment the value of score by 1\nUnder the if statement (outside the indented block), create a print\nMake the print statement print out the score variable\nprint(\"Score: \" + str(score))\n\n\n\nRun the program again, and verify that the score goes up with every victory!\n4. More Moves\nThis challenge may be quite difficult. One variation of the game adds two additional move options: Spock and Lizard. This version was invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, and later popularized by the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory.\nThe outcomes are as follows:\n\nIt adds this additional logic:\n\nRock vs. Spock - L\nRock vs. Lizard - W\nPaper vs. Spock - W\nPaper vs. Lizard - L\nScissors vs. Spock - L\nScissors vs. Lizard - W\n\nUpdate the program so that it can handle these additional cases.\n5.

This program will print a list of songs. This activity involves topics that have not been covered yet, so things may be unfamiliar - that's okay. Just try to follow the instructions as well as possible.\nThis activity should be completed in groups. Each group will present their playlist at the end of the activity. Here are the multiplayer Repl projects for the groups:\n\nGroup 1: https://repl.it/join/lftiuzlq-josephmaxwell\nGroup 2: https://repl.it/join/tmtybbae-josephmaxwell\nGroup 3: https://repl.it/join/antfmhcx-josephmaxwell\nGroup 4: https://repl.it/join/empfwtps-josephmaxwell\n\nClick on the link for your assigned group to begin.\nPart 1: Brainstorming Songs\nThe first thing to do is think of songs to add to the playlist! These could be any song from anywhere (as long as it is appropriate). Try to think of your favorite song(s) of all time. Feel free to include fake songs if desired. Each song should have a title and an artist.\n\nOpen the songs.txt file in the Repl project, and add songs there. Do not worry about the main.py file for now.\nEvery group member must contribute at least one song.\nThere must be at least 5 songs total.\n\nPart 2: Research\nBefore jumping into the code, take a look at some documentation. The code will use dictionaries and lists, two important collections in the Python world. Read through these articles as a group. One student should attempt to explain each topic to the rest of the group. Make sure to ask questions!\n\nPython Lists\nPython Dictionaries\n\nPart 3: Replacing Songs in the Python Code\nThe next step is to get into the actual code! Open up the main.py file to take a look.\n\nRun the code to see what it currently does\nNotice how each title and artist appear in the code\nNotice the placement of the curly brackets, colons, and commas\nFind the existing three songs in the code\nReplace each instance of \"All Star\" and \"Smash Mouth\" with titles/artists from the songs.txt file\nRun the code, and verify that the three new songs appear!\n\nPart 4: Adding More Songs\nNow the playlist should have some of the songs, but not all of them yet. Try to figure out how to add a couple more songs.\n\nFind the final song in the code, ending with },\nUnder that, type in a new {\nUnder that, add the \"title\": \"\", and \"artist\": \"\",\nUnder that, add another },\nRepeat the steps above once more\nMake sure the titles and artists reflect songs from the songs.txt file\nRun the code, and verify that all the songs appear!\n\nPart 5: Adding Color\nOne fun feature of Python is the ability to change the color of text in the console. This is possible using the colorama library, with the Fore object. Adding any Fore value in front of a printed string will turn the text that color. Update the code so that each song has its own color!\nPossible Colors\nFore.BLACK, Fore.RED, Fore.GREEN, Fore.YELLOW, Fore.BLUE, Fore.MAGENTA, Fore.CYAN, Fore.WHITE, Fore.RESET\nUpdating the Songs\nAdd a color to each song in its data, along with the \"title\" and \"artist\" values. Make sure to note the commas, curly brackets, and colons.\n\nFor the first song, find the \"title\" and \"artist\"\nRight under the \"artist\" line, above the },, make a new line\nDo something similar to the \"artist\" line, but use \"color\" instead\nOn the right side of the colon, add in Fore.RED   {\n     \"title\": \"All Star\",\n     \"artist\": \"Smash Mouth\",\n     \"color\": Fore.RED\n },\n\n\nUpdate all of the other songs in the same way, choosing different colors\n\nTry running the program. Nothing should have actually changed yet... \nUsing the Color\nNow that each song has a color, make sure the color is used when the song is printed!\n\nFind the print statement that prints out the song\nRight inside the parenthesis, make some space\nAdd in song[\"color\"]\nThis will access the color of the given song\n\n\nAfter that, add a + so it connects to the rest of the song\nAdding this will change the color for the text!\n\n\n\nRun the program again, and verify that each song appears with its own color!\nFinal Code\nBy the end of the activity, the code should look something like this:\nfrom colorama import Fore\n\nprint(\"Welcome to the Greatest Playlist Ever\")\n\nsongs = [\n    {\n        \"title\": \"All Star\",\n        \"artist\": \"Smash Mouth\",\n        \"color\": Fore.RED\n    },\n    {\n        \"title\": \"All Star 2\",\n        \"artist\": \"Smash Mouth\",\n        \"color\": Fore.CYAN\n    },\n    {\n        \"title\": \"All Star 3\",\n        \"artist\": \"Smash Mouth\",\n        \"color\": Fore.GREEN\n    },\n    {\n        \"title\": \"All Star 4\",\n        \"artist\": \"Smash Mouth\",\n        \"color\": Fore.YELLOW\n    },\n    {\n        \"title\": \"All Star 5\",\n        \"artist\": \"Smash Mouth\",\n        \"color\": Fore.MAGENTA\n    },\n]\n\nfor song in songs:\n    print(song[\"color\"] + song[\"title\"] + \" by \" + song[\"artist\"])\n\n"},"Collections/ScoreSortCodeAlong.html":{"url":"Collections/ScoreSortCodeAlong.html","title":"Sort By Score Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"Sort By Score\nIn this activity, create a program that can sort some players by their score. The sport/game/event in which they participate is up to you! These could be tennis players, basketball players, chess players, Super Smash Bros Melee players, or anything at all. The important thing is that they must have some numeric \"score\" attached to them.\nSetting Up\n\nGo to repl.it\nLog in\nCreate a new Python Repl project named \"Score Sort\"\n\nCreating the Players (Dictionaries)\nThe first step is to create a few players for the program. Think of some specific people who could be players, or just make people up! Ultimately, each player should be a dictionary with a \"name\" and a \"score\".\n\nAt the top of the main.py file, create a player1 variable\nSet player1 to equal a new dictionary: {}\nAdd a \"name\" key, and set it to some value (e.g. \"Alice Kostas\")\nAdd a \"score\" key, and set it to some value (e.g. 510)\nRepeat the steps above to create a player2 dictionary\nRepeat the steps above to create a player3 dictionary\nAdd code at the bottom to print out each created player dictionary\nRun the program, and verify that data for the three players appears!\n\nCode\nplayer1 = {\n    \"name\": \"Alice Kostas\",\n    \"score\": 510\n}\n\nplayer2 = {\n    \"name\": \"Justin Blake\",\n    \"score\": 400\n}\n\nplayer3 = {\n    \"name\": \"Gregoria Alonzo\",\n    \"score\": 390\n}\n\nprint(player1)\nprint(player2)\nprint(player3)\n\nCreating the List\nNow all the data is there, but it is not connected in any way. With this amount of data, it would be easy to simply look at the scores and put the players in order by hand. However, if there were ten or twenty or a thousand players, that would be unfeasible. So how can this data be stored? Using a list of course!\n\nAbove the player1 variable, create a new variable named players\nSet the players variable equal to a new list: []\nMove the data from each player variable into the list\nRemove the variable name and equals sign\nPlace the dictionary within the square brackets for the list\nAdd a comma after the closing curly bracket\n\n\nRemove the existing print statements\nCreate a new print statement that prints out the players variable\nRun the code, and verify that all the players appear!\n\nplayers = [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Alice Kostas\",\n        \"score\": 510\n    },\n\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Justin Blake\",\n        \"score\": 400\n    },\n\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Gregoria Alonzo\",\n        \"score\": 390\n    },\n]\n\nprint(players)\n\nUsing Selection Sort\nNow that the dataset exists, it's time to sort it! It may seem trivial with only three objects, but the sorting should work regardless of how many objects there are.\nAlgorithm Steps\nBefore diving into the code, refer back to the steps of the Selection Sort algorithm:\n\nFind the smallest value index in the list\nSwap that value with the current element\nRepeat with the rest of the list\n\nAnd the pseudocode:\nFor all elements:\n  Get remaining list\n\n  Find min element in list\n\n  Swap current with min\nIn this case, it is actually desirable to find the maximum value instead of the minimum. The algorithm won't change too much though. Ultimately, it should work something like this:\nLoop through each element in the list:\n  Find the index for the maximum value in the list starting at the current element\n  Swap the current element for the maximum value found\nThis visual demonstration may be helpful:\n\nDon't worry if this seems confusing. It takes a while to understand list sorting - just know that this will work!\nTurning Pseudocode into Python Code\nNow it's time to actually implement the algorithm. For this part, it will be assumed that some magical functions exist; they don't exist yet, but they will later!\n\nUnder the players list, create a while loop structure\nMake a new i variable set to 0\nCreate a while loop checking if i is less then the length of players\nIn the indented body of the loop, set i to itself plus 1\n\n\nIn the body of the while loop, above the increment, create a max_idx variable\nSet the variable to the result of a call to find_max_idx\nConsider the arguments needed for the find_max_idx function\nThe goal is to find the maximum value index between the current position and the end\nNeed to pass the players list\nNeed to pass the current index\n\n\nUnder that in the while, call the currently non-existent swap function\nThe goal is to swap the max value with the current position\nNeed to pass the players list\nNeed to pass the current position i\nNeed to pass the new value max_idx\n\n\n\nTry to think through what's happening in the algorithm and the code.\n\nWhile loop, starting at the beginning of the list, going through the end\nFor each position, find the maximum between the current position and the end of the list\nSwap the maximum with the current position\nNow, the list (up to the current position) will be sorted\n\nCode\ni = 0\nwhile i \nThe code won't work just yet... the find_max_idx and swap functions still need to be defined!\nFinding the Maximum\nFinding the maximum value in a list is actually another algorithm. Here are the steps:\nSet the current max index to the starting element\nFor each element in the remainder of the list:\n    If the element is greater than the element at the current max:\n        Set the current max index to the current position\n\nReturn the max after searching the whole list\nNow turn that into Python code!\nThe find_max_idx function\n\nAbove the while structure, define a function named find_max_idx\nParameter 1: collection (the list)\nParameter 2: starting_pos (the current position in the list)\n\n\nIn the indented body of the function, create a variable named max_idx\nSet max_idx to the starting_pos to begin\nAll other elements will be compared to this\n\n\nUnder that, create a pos variable set to starting_pos+1\nThis will track the position in the list\n\n\nCreate a while loop\nFor the while condition, check if pos is less than the collection length\nIn the indented body of the while loop, create a variable current_player\nSet current_player to the value in the collections list at pos\nUnder that, create a variable max_player\nSet max_player to the value in the collections list at max_idx\nUnder that, create an if statement\nFor the condition, check if the current_player score is greater than the max_player score\nIf it is, set the max_idx variable to pos\nAfter the if statement (not indented), increment the value of pos by 1\nAfter the while loop, return max_idx\nThis will have the maximum value index from the whole list\n\n\n\nCode\ndef find_max_idx(collection, starting_pos):\n    max_idx = starting_pos\n\n    pos = starting_pos+1\n    while pos  max_player[\"score\"]:\n            max_idx = pos\n        pos=pos+1\n\n    return max_idx\n\nThe code still won't run just yet... the swap function still needs to be defined.\nSwapping the Values\nSwapping two values in a list is a little simpler. At first thought, it might seem like a developer could just say something like:\nlist[index1] = list[index2]\nlist[index2] = list[index1]\nThe problem, however, is that once one element is changed, its value disappears! Using a temporary variable to store that value is one solution to this problem. Use it to define the swap function.\n\nUnder the find_max_idx function, define a new function named swap\nParameter 1: collection (the list)\nParameter 2: i (the first index for the swap)\nParameter 3: j (the second index for the swap)\n\n\nIn the indented body of the function, create a tmp variable\nSet the tmp variable to the element in collection at position i\nNow that the old value stored, set collection[i] to collection[j]\nFinally, set collection[j] to the stored tmp value\nRun the program, and verify that it does not error!\n\ndef swap(collection, i, j):\n    tmp = collection[i]\n    collection[i] = collection[j]\n    collection[j] = tmp\n\nNow, all of the functions have been defined. It's time to print out the results of the sorted list!\nPrinting the Results\nTo print the results, use a for loop.\n\nFind the very bottom of the main.py file\nUse a print statement to display a header saying \"-Top Players-\"\nUnder that, create a for loop structure\nfor keyword\nElement variable: p\nin keyword\nCollection: players\n\n\nIn the indented body of the for loop, create a variable named name\nSet the name variable to the \"name\" of the current element p\np[\"name\"]\n\n\nUnder that (still indented), create a variable named score\nSet the score variable to the \"score\" of the current element p, wrapped in a str()\nstr(p[\"score\"])\n\n\nUnder the score variable, create a print statement\nIn the print, print the name and the score, added together with \": \" in the middle\n\nprint(\"-Top Players-\")\nfor p in players:\n    name = p[\"name\"]\n    score = str(p[\"score\"])\n    print(name + \": \" + score)\n\nRun the code, and verify that the top players appear, printed nicely! Try changing around the values a bit to make sure the sorting actually works.\nFinal Code\nplayers = [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Alice Kostas\",\n        \"score\": 510\n    },\n\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Justin Blake\",\n        \"score\": 400\n    },\n\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Gregoria Alonzo\",\n        \"score\": 390\n    },\n]\n\ndef find_max_idx(collection, starting_pos):\n    max_idx = starting_pos\n\n    pos = starting_pos+1\n    while pos  max_player[\"score\"]:\n            max_idx = pos\n        pos=pos+1\n\n    return max_idx\n\ndef swap(collection, i, j):\n    tmp = collection[i]\n    collection[i] = collection[j]\n    collection[j] = tmp\n\ni = 0\nwhile i \nChallenges\nAfter the activity, start working on the Score Sort Challenges.\n"},"Collections/ScoreSortChallenges.html":{"url":"Collections/ScoreSortChallenges.html","title":"Sort By Score Challenges","keywords":"","body":"Sort By Score Challenges\nAfter completing the code-along, attempt the challenges below.\nOptional Practice: Bug Fixes\nView these buggy Repl projects and try to fix them. To make things easier, reference the completed code from the code-along, and compare it to the buggy code. Test each program and make sure that they all work properly!\n\nBug 1\nBug 2\nBug 3\nBug 4\nNote: there are 3 bugs in the last one!\n\n\n\n1. Add More Data\nNow, getting back to the code-along code. The current list only has a few items, so sorting them isn't all that impressive. Add at least three more dictionary items to the players list.\n\nAdd a comma at the end of the last item in the list\nCreate the structure for the new dictionary: {}\nWithin the new dictionary, add a \"name\" key with a new value\nWithin the new dictionary, add a \"score\" key with a new value\nRepeat until there are at least three new items\nRun the code, and verify that the sorting still works based on the score!\n\n2. Multiple Scores\nOften, a score will be an amalgamation of several scores. For example, the total score of a football game is the sum of the scores from each quarter. Track multiple scores for each dictionary item in the list.\n\nAdd a \"score2\" key to each item in the list\nGive a value to each \"score2\" property\nIn the other part of the code, find the find_min_idx function definition\nFind the if statement where two things are compared\nUpdate the condition so that it takes both \"score\" and \"score2\" into account\nIt should check the score plus the score2 value\n\n\nFind the part of the code that prints out the top players\nUpdate it so it prints the total score instead of simply the score\nAgain, it should be score plus score2\n\n\nRun the program, and verify that the sorting works with the new scores!\n\n3. Custom Players\n\nThis challenge may be fairly challenging. Feel free to skip down to the next one if desired.\n\nRight now, the program only uses hard-coded players. This works for demonstrative purposes, but it would be more useful if the user of the program could add their own data. Update the code so this is possible!\n\nPlace the sorting code in a new function: sort\nTake in the collection, and run the existing while code on it\n\n\nAt the bottom of the file, create a while True loop that repeats infinitely\nIn the body of the loop, ask the user what to do\nCreate an if for each command\nIf they want to add a player:\nAsk them for player information\nCreate a new player dictionary\nAdd the new dictionary to the players list\n\n\nIf they want to see the players:\nSort the players list\nPrint out the players in the list\n\n\nIf they want to exit:\nUse break to exit the loop\n\n\n\nThis should make it possible for users to add as many players as they would like, and see them sorted!\nBONUS: Multiple Sorting Methods\nOften, when viewing data, it is possible to sort the data in multiple ways. Add in the ability for the program to sort the players by:\n\nScore (low to high)\nName (alphabetical)\nName (reverse alphabetical)\n\n4. Rock Paper Scissors Redux\n\nThis challenge could be somewhat challenging.\n\nFor this challenge, is totally separate from the score sorting program; start by making a new Repl project and go from there.\nThe goal is to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using a dictionary. It should be similar to the Rock Paper Scissors code, but it will simplify things a bit.\nA Dictionary of Victories\nThe old way of doing Rock Paper Scissors involved several if statements. Those worked, but there seemed to be a lot of repetitive code. By using a dictionary, the code will be much more dynamic.\nHere's the idea: create one dictionary object where the keys represent a possible move, and the value represents the move that that move beats. Like this:\n1. key: Rock, value: Scissors (rock beats scissors)\n2. key: Paper, value: Rock (paper beats rock)\n3. key: Scissors, value: Paper (scissors beats paper)\nThat's all the information needed to determine the winner of a match!\n\nAt the top of the file, create a new variable named victories\nSet the victories variable equal to a new dictionary: {}\nAdd a key of \"R\" to the dictionary with a value of \"S\"\nAdd keys of \"P\" and \"S\" with the proper values\n\nNow the code contains the dictionary determining which move beats which.\nA Battle Function\nThe next step is to use the victories dictionary to determine the winner between two competitors. This should happen in a function named battle.\n\nUnder the victories dictionary, define a new function named battle\ndef keyword, space\nfunction name (battle)\nparentheses\nParameter 1: player\nParameter 2: computer\n\n\nIn the indented body of the battle function, create an if statement\nFor the if condition, check if player and computer are equal\nIf they are, print out \"Tie\"\nOutside of the if statement, create an elif statement\nFor the elif, check if the value for the victories dictionary with a key of player is equal to computer\nIf it is, print out \"Player Wins\"\nOutside of that if, create an else\nIn the else, print out \"Computer Wins\"\n\nRun the code to make sure it works - but it shouldn't do anything yet!\nTesting\nUnder the definition of the battle function, call the battle function with a few test inputs. Make sure that every possible outcome can be achieved.\nFor example, it could be called in this manner:\nbattle(\"P\", \"S\")\n\nThe code above should cause the program to print out Computer Wins, because paper loses to scissors.\n5. Another Sorting Algorithm\n\nThis challenge is quite challenging.\n\nTry to implement a different sorting algorithm to sort the list of players! There is a lot of code available online to help. The biggest challenge is adapting the code to work for the specific solution. Here are some ideas:\n\nInsertion Sort\nBubble Sort\n\nMore Challenging\nThese two algorithms are a little more challenging to implement - they require using recursion.\n\nMerge Sort\nQuickSort\n\n"},"DiscordBot/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"DiscordBot/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 4 - Discord Bot","keywords":"","body":""},"WebScraping/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"WebScraping/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 5 - Web Scraping","keywords":"","body":"Web Scraping with Python\nLearn how to use web scraping to extract data from a website using Python.

The name is derived from the French term crochet, meaning “small hook.” Hooks can be made from a variety of materials, such as metal, wood, bamboo, or plastic. The key difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before the next one is begun, while knitting keeps many stitches open at a time. Some variant forms of crochet, such as Tunisian crochet and broomstick lace, do keep multiple crochet stitches open at a time.\n            Knitted textiles survive from as early as the 11th century CE, but the first substantive evidence of crocheted fabric emerges in Europe during the 19th century.

At the very top of the main.py file, add the following code to import the requests library:\nimport requests\n\nMore information about this library is available here.\nRetrieving Information Manually\nAs a human being, it's not too hard to go to Wikipedia and find some information. Giving that ability to a computer program is a little less straightforward, but it is certainly possible!\nAs a human, it would make sense to go to Wikipedia and type something into the search bar. For example, typing in \"Apple\" would lead to this page:\n\n\nBehind the scenes, that actually sends the web browser to this url: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=apple\nIn fact, anything can be appended to the end of that URL in order to find the corresponding Wikipedia page! This will be extremely helpful for the Info Finder.\nRetrieving Information in Python\nUsing the requests library, it is possible to pull down all of the HTML code from a URL. Update the get_information function so that it prints out some raw HTML (for now).\n\nFind the get_information function, and make a new line at the top of the body\nCreate a variable named url\nSet url to this string: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=\"\nAt the end of the line, add + search_term to add on the search term from the user\nThis way, the URL will always reflect what the user hopes to find\n\n\nUnder that, create a variable named response\nSet the response variable to requests.get(url)\nHere, the requests.get function is able to retrieve the info from the web\n\n\nUnder that, create a variable named html_text\nSet the html_text variable to equal response.text\nThis gets the raw HTML from the response\n\n\nUnder that, use print to print the html_text variable\nRun the program, enter a search term, and verify that a mess of HTML appears!\n\nurl = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=\" + search_term\n\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nhtml_text = response.text\nprint(html_text)\n\nBeautiful Soup\nNow the program has a bunch of HTML, but it's not very readable. It's time to parse it using BeautifulSoup, a Python library designed to help extract information from HTML text!\nRight under the first import statement in the code, add the following line:\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nBefore jumping into the code, think about what is necessary to find in the HTML.\nLooking at the HTML\nEvery Wikipedia page is a little different, so it's important to make sure the HTML parsing solution works for all (or at least the majority) of them. Take a look at some of the HTML for a page.\n\nOpen a separate browser window\nGo to the Wikipedia page for Apple\nRight click somewhere on the first paragraph\nSelect \"Inspect\" to open Developer Tools\nTry to find the first paragraph text in the HTML\nIt may be a little jumbled, but the text should be there\n\n\nNotice that the text is within a p element\nNotice that that p element is within a div element\nNotice that the div element has a class attribute of mw-parser-output\nNotice that the important p is not the first p within that div\n\nAll of this investigation should help when writing the code.\nParsing the HTML in Python\nNow it's time to get into the code!\n\nFind the spot in the find_information function where html_text is printed\nRemove that line as it is no longer necessary\nIn its place, create a new variable named html_document\nSet the html_document variable to the result of a call to the BeautifulSoup function\nPass in html_text as the first parameter\nPass in \"html.parser\" (don't forget the quotes) as the second parameter\n\n\nUnder that, create a new variable named search_criteria\nConsider what the program needs to find first\n\n\nSet the search_criteria variable to a new dictionary: {}\nAdd a key of \"class\" to the dictionary, with a value of \"mw-parser-output\"\nThis will be able to find the appropriate div in the HTML\n\n\nUnder that, create a variable named content_div\nSet the content_div variable to html_document.find(\"div\", search_criteria)\nThis searches the html_document for div elements with a class of mw-parser-output\n\n\nUnder that, create a new variable named paragraphs\nSet the paragraphs variable to content_div.find_all(\"p\")\nThis will be all of the p elements within the div\n\n\n\nhtml_document = BeautifulSoup(html_text, \"html.parser\")\n\nsearch_criteria = {\n    \"class\": \"mw-parser-output\"\n}\n\ncontent_div = html_document.find(\"div\", search_criteria)\nparagraphs = content_div.find_all(\"p\")\n\nThe Right Paragraph\nNow all the possible paragraphs have been found, but only the first non-empty one is needed. Loop through the paragraphs, and return the text for the first non-empty one!\n\nUnder the paragraphs variable, create a for loop\nLoop through each paragraph in paragraphs\nIn the indented body of the for loop, create a variable named p_text\nSet the p_text variable to paragraph.get_text()\nThis will hold the raw text for the paragraph\n\n\nUnder that, create a variable named clean_text\nSet the clean_text variable to p_text.strip()\nThis will remove any whitespace from the text\n\n\nUnder that, still within the for body, create an if statement\nFor the condition of the if, simply put clean_text\nThis will be True for all non-empty string values\n\n\nIn the indented body of the if: return clean_text\nRun the code, enter a search term, and verify that the first paragraph appears!\n\nfor paragraph in paragraphs:\n    p_text = paragraph.get_text()\n    clean_text = p_text.strip()\n\n    if clean_text:\n        return clean_text\n\nNice Printing\nThere is one last thing to make the program a little nicer to use. Currently, the text will break a new line in the middle of a word. This is not ideal! Luckily, there is another Python library to handle it. At the top of the file, along with the other imports, add the following:\nfrom textwrap import fill\n\nThe fill function will add newline characters in between strings so that they print out a little nicer.

Update it so that instead of simply displaying the first paragraph, it displays all of them.\nUpdating the Function\n\nFind the get_information function in the code\nIn the body of the function, find the for paragraph in paragraphs loop\nAbove the loop, create a new variable named para_texts\nSet the variable equal to a new empty list: []\nThis will hold the text from each paragraph\n\n\nIn the body of the loop, find the if clean_text: statement\nIn the body of the if, remove the return statement\nIn its place, add clean_text to the para_texts list\nOutside of the for loop, remove the return \"No Info...\" statement\nIn its place, return the para_texts list\n\nThe program won't work just yet... it will be necessary to update the call to the get_information function.\nUpdating the Call\n\nFind where the get_information function is called\nChange the variable to be named info_paras\nCreate a new for loop to loop through each paragraph text\nFor each text, wrap it in a call to the fill function and print it\nAbove the loop, create an if statement\nFor the condition, check if len(info_paras) is 0\nIf it is, print a message saying \"No Information Found\"\n\nRun the program and verify that all the paragraphs appear!\nBONUS: Custom Number of Paragraphs\nInstead of simply printing out all of the paragraphs, ask the user how many to print! In the for loop body, after printing each paragraph, ask the user if they would like to continue. If they choose not to continue, break out of the loop.\n2. Printing a Table of Contents\nIn addition to finding the paragraphs of information on each page, find the table of contents information.\n\nIn the get_information function, find the html_document variable\nUnder that variable, create a variable named toc_search\nSet the toc_search variable to be a new dictionary: {}\nIn the toc_search dictionary, add a key of \"id\" with a value of \"toc\"\nUnder that, create a variable named toc\nSet the toc variable to equal a call to html_document.find\nFor the find call, pass in \"div\" for the element type as the first parameter\nFor the second parameter, pass in the toc_search variable\nUnder that, create a variable named toc_text\nSet the toc_text variable to equal toc.get_text()\nThis will return the text content for the table of contents\n\n\nFinally, print out the toc_text variable\n\nRun the code, enter a search term, and verify that the table of contents text appears!\n3. Philosophy Game\n\nThis challenge will be quite challenging.\n\nOne interesting thing about Wikipedia articles is that if you click on the first non-parenthesized, non-italicized link on the page, and repeat the process, it will almost always lead to the Philosophy page. Check out this article for more information. There is also this video about the subject:\n\n\nRecreate the philosophy game using a Python script! The program should work as follows:\n\nAsk the user for a page to visit\nLoad the page using requests/BeautifulSoup\nFind the first link on the page\nAvoid references to the same page, and citation links\nFor an extra challenge, avoid parenthetical links as well\n\n\nLoad the page at the new URL\nRepeat the process!\n\nNote that \"Philosophy\" may be unreachable if parenthetical links are included. It will still be interesting to see where the journey goes though!\n4. Scraping Another Webpage\n\nThis challenge could be challenging depending on the website.\n\nExperiment with different websites! Try to extract data from an interesting place. Try to make it dynamic; create programs that ask the user what to do. Theoretically, any website could be scraped; it's all about looking at the HTML and figuring out how to grab the information.\n"},"Flask/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Flask/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 6 - Flask Web Server","keywords":"","body":"Web Server with Flask\nLearn how to use Flask to build a simple web server in Python.

Read through some of the basic concepts to become familiar with them.\nFlask Boiler-Plate and Repl.it\nWhen creating a new Python project on repl.it, it is possible to load some Flask boiler-plate code. Running that code will spin up a webserver. Repl.it hosts the server and navigates to the website. It looks like this:\n\n\nRouting\nWhen building a web app, it is important to determine which things happen at which URLs. This is called routing.\nOne of the most important parts of the boiler-plate code is the following decorator:\n@app.route('/')\n\nAdding that line above a function will tell the Flask app that when the user goes to the root URL, the function below it should run.\nTo create another page, a developer would use a different @app.route value. For example, take a look at the following code:\n@app.route('/about')\ndef about_page():\n    return \"Here is some information about the site\"\n\nThat decorator means that if someone went to the base URL with /about at the end, it would run the about_page function and display the text returned.\nThere are some interesting ways to extend the routing capabilities, but for now, keep it simple: @app.route tells the app which functions map to which pages.\nHTML Templates\nIn the boiler-plate code, the app only displays raw text. This may be all that's necessary, but typically, it would make sense to render some HTML. That's where templates come in.\nA template is a file that contains static data (like HTML) as well as placeholders for dynamic data (more on that later). For now, focus on the static data part.\nIn a Repl project for a full-fledged Flask app, there will likely be a folder named templates. The name is very important, because that specific folder is where Flask looks for template files. For example, if there were a file named home.html in the templates folder, it could be rendered by the app.\nrender_template\nIn order to use templates, it is necessary to import the render_template function from Flask. Like this:\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\n\nThen, that function can be used to render some HTML! Instead of returning regular text like \"Hello world,\" the render_template function takes in a filename and returns the rendered HTML. For example:\n@app.route('/')\ndef home():\n    return render_template(\"home.html\")\n\nThe code above would cause the homepage (root url) to display the rendered contents of the home.html file (assuming it is in the templates folder)!\nTemplates make it much easier to work with HTML in Flask; instead of having to put a bunch of HTML within Python strings, it can be contained in HTML files.\nPassing Variables\nOne of the main capabilities of templates in Flask is the ability to dynamically render templates. This is possible by passing variables as keyword arguments. This way, instead of creating many different functions and templates, it can be possible to create one of each and simply change up the variables passed.\nIn the Python Code\nOn the Python side, passing a variable to a template looks like this:\nrender_template(\"home.html\", name=\"Elaine\")\n\nThat second name argument in the call to the render_template function means that the value will be accessible from the template! This won't matter too much if it's a static value, but there is potential to make it more dynamic.\nIn the HTML Template\nOn the HTML side, using a variable in a template looks like this:\nHello, {{ name }}!\n\nEnclosing something in double curly brackets, {{ and }}, means that Flask will look for a dynamic value by that name. In the example from above, the finally-rendered HTML would look like this:\nHello, Elaine!\n\nThe render_template function goes in and replaces the {{ name }} in the template with the value of the name variable. That way, the same page can say hello to any number of different names!\nSummary\nHere are some important notes to remember:\n\nFlask is a web development framework for Python\nDifferent pages can be routed to Python functions using the @app.route decorator\nHTML can be rendered from Python using the render_template function\nVariables can be passed to the template using keyword arguments\nVariables can be referenced within a template between {{ and }}\n\nDon't worry if this is a little overwhelming - there will be plenty of time to practice!\n"},"Flask/FlaskCodeAlong.html":{"url":"Flask/FlaskCodeAlong.html","title":"Random Joke Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"Random Joke Website\nIn this activity, create a Flask Web Server that serves a random joke website. The goal is for the user to be able to see a random joke every time the joke page loads.\nSetting Up\n\nGo to repl.it\nLog in\nCreate a new Python Repl project named \"Random Joke Website\"\nAt the top of the main.py file, click on the \"examples\" link \nFrom there, select the \"Server (Flask)\" option \nRun the program to see the boiler-plate Flask app render!\n\nThe Code So Far\nThe boiler-plate code should look like this:\nfrom flask import Flask\napp = Flask('app')\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello_world():\n    return 'Hello, World!'\n\napp.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)\n\nThere aren't many lines, but they may be a little confusing. Here's a quick breakdown of what each line does:\nfrom flask import Flask # imports the Flask library\napp = Flask('app') # initializes the Flask app variable\n\n@app.route('/') # sets a route for the app - the root\ndef hello_world(): # defines a function to handle that route\n    return 'Hello, World!' # returns text to display\n\napp.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080) # runs the app locally\n\nRendering HTML\nCurrently, the homepage has some simple text. However, it is possible to update that text to display HTML instead!\nUpdate the hello_world function so that it returns Hello, World!. Run the program to see the HTML render!\nCreating an HTML File\nThis is working, but it would be difficult to write an entire HTML document in Python. Luckily, the Flask library has the ability to render full HTML files too. The first step is to create one.\n\nOn the left side of the Repl.it page, click the \"Add folder\" icon \nEnter \"templates\" for the folder name, and press Enter \nClick the three dots by the \"templates\" folder, and then the \"Add file\" button \nEnter \"home.html\" for the name of the file\n\nNow there should be a templates folder, and a file named home.html within that folder. The name of the folder is important; make sure it is templates.\nNext, open up the home.html file, and add the following code:\ntemplates/home.html\n\n    \n        Welcome to my Website\n        This is one of the greatest websites of all time.\n    \n\n\nThis is a simple page, but it is much easier to have the code in a file instead of in a string!\nUsing the HTML File\nThe next step is using the HTML file in the Flask app.\n\nOpen the main.py file\nAt the top of the file, find the from flask line\nAt the end of the line, add , render_template   from flask import Flask, render_template\n\n\nFind the hello_world function, and rename it home\nIn the body of the home function, remove the current return\nIn its place, call the render_template function, passing in \"home.html\"\nReturn the result of the function call\nStop the server and run it again to see the updated home page!\n\nmain.py\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\napp = Flask('app')\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef home():\n    return render_template(\"home.html\")\n\napp.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)\n\nAdding Another Page\nAdding additional pages to the web server will be very similar to creating the first page. This second page will have a joke for the user.\nA New HTML File\nThe first step is creating a new HTML file. Add a file named joke.html to the templates folder. Note that the file must be within the proper folder; otherwise it will not work. Once the file has been created, add the following HTML code:\ntemplates/joke.html\n\n    \n        Joke Page\n        Here is a joke for you:\n        \n            How do you tell when you're out of invisible ink?\n        \n        Go back home\n    \n\n\nA New Route Function\nThe next step is to create a new route function for the joke page.\n\nIn the main.py file, define a new function named joke\nIn the body of the joke function, call the render_template function\nIn the call, pass in \"joke.html\" as the parameter\nReturn the result of the call\nOn the line above the function definition, add an @app.route\nFor the route argument, use '/joke'\nThis means the page will be available at {examplename.name}.repl.co/joke\n\n\n\nRun the project, and notice that the homepage still appears. That's what's supposed to be happening. What's missing is that the homepage has no link to the new page!\nUpdating the home.html File\nOpen up the templates/home.html file, and find the . Right underneath it, add the following HTML:\ntemplates/home.html\nGet a Joke\n\nWith that, a link to the joke page should appear! Try running the project again. Verify that it is possible to click the link and go to the joke page!\nA Random Joke\nNow comes the fun part. The website so far is not bad, but it would be a lot better if there were more jokes! Update the server so that, instead of only displaying one joke, it displays a random joke every time the joke page loads.\nSetup\nPython has a built-in random library to help with all things random. At the top of the main.py file, right under the other import, add the following line:\nfrom random import choice\n\nThat will import the choice function, which can choose a random item from a list. It is extremely helpful for this situation. All that's missing is a list!\nTo save time, copy the following jokes list into the main.py file (under the app variable):\njokes = [\n    \"I saw a bank that said '24 Hour Banking,' but I don't have that much time.\",\n    \"I went to a general store. They wouldn't let me buy anything specifically.\",\n    \"A computer once beat me at chess, but it was no match for me at kick boxing.\",\n    \"How do you tell when you’re out of invisible ink?\",\n    \"Saying 'I'm sorry' is the same as saying 'I apologize.' Except at a funeral.\",\n    \"I went into a clothes store and a lady came up to me and said 'if you need anything, I'm Jill'. I never met anyone with a conditional identity before.\",\n    \"I find that a duck's opinion of me is very much influenced over whether or not I have bread.\",\n    \"I haven't slept for 10 days... because that would be too long.\",\n    \"I'm against picketing, but I don't know how to show it.\"\n]\n\nThe program should pick a random joke from the list.\nCreating the Random Joke\nThe next step is to actually use the jokes list!\n\nFind the joke function\nMake a new line at the top of the body of the function\nIn the body, create a variable named random_joke\nSet the variable to equal a call to the choice function\nPass in the jokes list as the variable\n\n\nIn the call to render_template, add a comma after the first argument\nAdd joke=random_joke to pass in the random_joke to the template\nThis is an example of a keyword argument\n\n\n\n@app.route('/joke')\ndef joke():\n    random_joke = choice(jokes)\n    return render_template(\"joke.html\", joke=random_joke)\n\nNow the joke.html template will have access to the random joke!\nDisplaying the Random Joke\nNow that the joke is properly passed to the template, it will be possible to display it in the HTML.\n\nOpen the templates/joke.html file\nFind the existing joke text\nReplace the text with {{ joke }}\nBecause the joke argument was passed in render_template, this will contain a joke!\n\n\nUnder the , create a  element\nWithin the  and , create an  element\nSet the href attribute of the a to \"?\"\nThis will cause a refresh when the link is clicked\n\n\nWithin the a, add the text \"Get another joke\"\n\ntemplates/joke.html\n\n    {{ joke }}\n\nGet another joke\n\nRun the project again and test it out! It should generate a random joke every time the joke page loads.\nAdding Some Style\nThe last step is to use CSS to add some style to the site! This isn't strictly necessary, but it can make the user experience much more engaging.\nCSS File\nFirst, create a CSS file in the proper place.\n\nCreate a folder named static\nWithin that folder, create a file named style.css\n\nAdd the following code to the file:\nstatic/style.css\nbody {\n    font-family: sans-serif;\n    background-color: darkgreen;\n    color: gold;\n}\n\na {\n    color: white;\n    text-decoration: none;\n}\n\na:hover {\n    font-weight: bold;\n}\n\nblockquote {\n    border: 1px dotted gold;\n    padding: 10px;\n    width: 300px;\n}\n\nHTML Files\nNow, the HTML files must be updated to point to the static/style.css file.\nAdd the following code to the home.html and joke.html files (within the , above the ):\n\n    \n\n\nSeeing the Website\nSometimes, Repl.it has issues with static CSS files. This is because they can be cached, which means they don't always refresh with changes.\nTo help with this, open the Repl project in another tab:\n\nFrom there, it should be possible to press Ctrl+F5 to clear the cache and refresh the page. Verify that the pages are nicely styled!\nFinal Code\nReview the final code for each file. Make sure to note the folder structure of the project. There is also a Repl project containing the complete web app.\nmain.py\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\nfrom random import choice\napp = Flask('app')\n\njokes = [\n    \"I saw a bank that said '24 Hour Banking,' but I don't have that much time.\",\n    \"I went to a general store.

Note that students will be expected to present their websites, so complete the first challenge (new jokes) at minimum!\n1. New Jokes\nReplace the existing jokes list with a new list; either write your own, or search for some existing jokes! Make sure the jokes are appropriate.\nAfter updating the jokes, change up some of the styles. Open the static/style.css file, and change the following:\n\nbackground color\ntext color\nfont\n\n2. Quotes\nA website about jokes is nice, but it is a little restrictive. Update it so that it provides a random quote in addition to a random joke. This way, there are a lot more options for what to show. Note that this will be extremely similar to the Joke page; for the purposes of this exercise, much of it can be copied and pasted.\nPython Code\nOpen the main.py file, and make the following changes:\n\nUnder the jokes list, create a new list named quotes\nFor now, add a couple of quotes to the list (more can be added later):  \n\"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.\"\n\"The future ain't what it used to be.\"\n\n\nUnder the joke function, define a function named quote  \nIt should have no parameters\n\n\nAbove the quote function, add the @app.route line, pointing to \"/quote\"\nIn the body of the quote function, create a variable named random_quote\nSet the random_quote variable to choice(quotes)\nUnder that, return a call to render_template  \nPass in \"quote.html\" and quote=random_quote\n\n\nCheck that the quote function matches the joke function for the most part\n\nNote that this will not work just yet; there is currently no quote.html file.\nHTML Template Code\nThe next step is to add a quote.html file and update the home.html file.\n\nIn the templates folder, create a new file named quote.html\nCopy the code from the joke.html file into the quote.html file\nChange the h1 text so that it says \"Quote Page\"\nChange the p text so that it says \"Here is a quote for you\"\nChange the {{ joke }} to {{ quote }} \nThis is because a different value is passed to render_template in the Python\n\n\nChange the first a text so that it says \"Get another quote\"\nOpen the home.html file\nUnder the existing a element, add another \nSet the href of the second a to point to /quote\nMake the text of the second a say \"Get a quote\"\n\nRun the program and verify that it is possible to go to the Quote Page!\nFind More Quotes\nNow the fun part: find more quotes! These can be quotes from movies, books, songs, or whatever else. Update the quotes list in the main.py file so that it contains some updated quotes.\n3. A Hello Page\nCreate another page - a \"Hello\" page - that greets the user based on a name passed in the URL. This is possible using URL Converters. These can turn values from URLs into Python variables.\nBy the end of this challenge, the user should be go to a URL like \"proj.name.repl.co/hello/Joan\" and the page should say \"Hello Joan!\" It should work for any name passed in the URL.\nPython Code\nFirst, change the code in the main.py file.\n\nUnder the existing route functions, define a new function named hello\nGive the hello function one parameter: username\nAbove the function, add the @app.route decorator\nFor the URL, pass in /hello/  \nNote the <> around username - that means it will be the parameter!\n\n\nIn the body of the hello function, add a return statement\nReturn render_template, passing in \"hello.html\" and name=username\nThis will pass the URL username variable into the \"hello.html\" template\n\n\n\nThis will not work just yet, because there is no file named hello.html.\nHTML Template Code\nNext, create a proper HTML template to render.\n\nIn the templates folder, create a file named hello.html\nOpen the file, and add basic boiler-plate HTML elements to it: html, body\nBetween the  and  add a \nMake the text say Hello {{ name }}!\nThis will render the name passed in the Python code\n\n\nUnder the h1, add a p saying \"I hope you enjoy the site\"\n\nNow the new route should work! It will not be linked from anywhere, but that should not be a problem.\nTesting the Hello Page\nTesting the page is easiest when the site is opened in a new window:\n\nAfter that, append /hello/Name to see it say hello! Verify that it can say hello to any name provided in the URL.\n4. Make Something New\nUse Flask to create a completely new website! There are several options. If desired, take a look at this tutorial to learn some more advanced template concepts, which will make it possible to do a lot more with Flask!\nOptional Practice: Bug Fixing\nFind and fix all of the bugs in the programs below. Note that the projects may have multiple bugs - fix all of them!\n\nBug 1\nBug 2\nBug 3\nBug 4\n\n"}}}

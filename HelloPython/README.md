# Hello Python
This lesson introduces the Python programming language using Turtle Graphics. Since this is the first meeting of the semester, it will also be important to go over ground rules and start building the classroom culture.

## Introductions
The instructors should introduce themselves and provide an overview of course expectations. Go over the course schedule and goals for the students.

## Icebreaker Activity
The main goal of the icebreaker is to make the students feel comfortable in the classroom environment. This should give them a chance to get to know each other, as well as giving the instructors a chance to get to know them.

## PowerPoint Presentation
Present the [Hello Python](HelloPython.pptx) PowerPoint Presentation.

## Code-Along Activity
The [activity](TurtleCodeAlong.md) walks through a basic turtle graphics program. The intent is not to teach any specific concept; it is designed to give the students a fun and colorful introduction to the language, and familiarize them with the syntax.

## Challenges
With any time remaining after the code-along activity, students can work on the [challenges](TurtleChallenges.md). If any students create anything cool, take some time for them to share with the rest of the group.

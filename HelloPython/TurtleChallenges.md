# Turtle Challenges
After completing the [Turtle Code-Along](TurtleCodeAlong.md), take a look at these challenges.

## Turtle Bugs
Each of the following repl.it projects contains a bug. Diagnose them and try to fix them, using the code fom the code-along as a reference point.

>HINT: Check the console for error messages!

## Other Turtle Powers
Turtles can do a whole lot. Play around with some of these different capabilities.

### Speed
>https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.speed

It is possible to change the speed the turtle moves with `turtle.speed()`. Make the turtle move faster or slower depending on the situation!

### Pen Size
>https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.pensize

It is possible to change the width of the pen drawing for the turtle with `turtle.pensize()` or `turtle.width()`. Drawing thicker or thinner lines can make for much more interesting designs!

### Showing and Hiding
>https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.hideturtle  
>https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.showturtle

It is possible to hide the turtle, and then show it again with `turtle.hideturtle()` and `turtle.showturtle()`. This can make designs look much cleaner, and the turtle can draw faster when it is hidden!

### Pen Fills
>https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.begin_fill  
>https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.end_fill

It is possible to fill in shapes using `turtle.begin_fill()` and `turtle.end_fill()`. Use `begin_fill` before the shape drawing begins, and `end_fill` after the drawing ends. The fill will be the color of the turtle. Remember to use both `begin_fill` and `end_fill` to make sure the shapes are properly filled!

### Turtle Talk
>https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.write

It is possible for turtles to write text to the screen using `turtle.write`. This can make turtle programs much more dynamic; this capability could even be used for some storytelling!

## Draw a Turtle
Try to use all of the turtle capabilities to draw a real turtle! It can be as simple or as complex as desired.

## New Mexico State Flag
Try to recreate the [New Mexico State Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_New_Mexico) as accurately as possible using turtle graphics.

## Complete Drawing
Use all of the turtle knowledge above to create a complete drawing. It could be a house, a cat, a star, a person; anything!

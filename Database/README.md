# The Replit DB in Python
This lesson introduces the [Replit DB](https://docs.replit.com/misc/database). It covers some database basics, and then shows how to specifically work with the replit.com key-value store. This lesson is loosely based on [this tutorial](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/databases/replit-database).

## PowerPoint Presentation
Present the [Databases Overview](DatabasesOverview.pptx) PowerPoint Presentation. Review the presentation ahead of time, including the notes in the slides. There are several animations.

## Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/6419ccb43360ef9962e2fe22) covering the content from the lecture. Note that an account is required to host the game.

## Code-Along Activity
The [activity](RestaurantReviewCodeAlong.md) walks through the construction of a Restaurant Review application (with data backed by the Replit DB). This should reinforce all of the concepts from the PowerPoint.

## Challenges
The [challenges](DatabaseChallenges.md) task students with building on the Restaurant Review application, and/or doing something else with a database.

## Final Project
Toward the end of the lesson, it may be a good idea to introduce the [final project](../FinalProject/).

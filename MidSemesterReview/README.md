# Mid-Semester Review
Use this session to review the concepts covered so far, and check in with students individually. This session will also be a chance to have some fun and have everybody get to know each other a little better.

## Objectives
There are no particular learning objectives for this session. Students should have a chance to:

- Review concepts from previous sessions
- Interact socially

The main focus will be the [check-ins](https://github.com/hytechclub/hytechclub.github.io/blob/main/CheckIns.md#check-ins).

## Self-Paced Time
This time will be very free, but it will be important for every student to at least _try_ to review/practice a little bit. There are a number of things they can do.

Present each of these options to the students, and then let them decide what they would like to do!

### Challenges
Students can follow [these instructions](Challenges.md) to work on some additional challenges - some are from previous lessons, and some are online & interactive.

### Library
There is a [Library](Library.md) of videos and articles for the students to peruse. Some of them are directly related to the course material, and some are only somewhat relevant. If there is interest, some of the videos could be projected for the entire class to view. If a student wants to watch a video on their own, they should use headphones.

### Final Project Planning
If a student wants to spend some time brainstorming [final project](../FinalProject/README.md) ideas, or even starting to build something, they should be welcome to do that! They will be required to incorporate concepts that have yet to be learned, but they can start thinking and tinkering if they want.

## Games
If the students complete enough of the review activities satisfactorily, there should be some time for games. [Gartic Phone](https://garticphone.com/) or [Drawasaurus](https://www.drawasaurus.org/) are recommended, but feel free to take suggestions from the students about what they'd like to play!

These games can take place while check-ins continue.

## Baamboozle Team Quiz
Hopefully, all check-ins will be completed with some time to spare at the end. At that point, bring everybody together and facilitate the [Baamboozle Team Quiz](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/1488086). The students should split into two teams, and the instructor should click through questions. Note that Baamboozle is _very_ unfair when using power-ups, and the best team may not win - but that's okay!

# Collections in Python
Learn how to work with [lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp) and [dictionaries](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp) in Python, and explore some list sorting algorithms. Start with by completing the **Playlist Warm-up Activity** (with a group). Next, review the **Collections PowerPoint Presentation** below. Then, complete the **Sort By Score Code-Along Activity**. Once that's done, work on the **Sort By Score Challenges**.

## Playlist Warm-up Activity
Once in a group, go to [this page](PlaylistWarmup.md) to complete the warm-up. A link to the multiplayer Repl project will be there, along with instructions for the activity.

## Sort By Score Code-Along Activity
Follow the instructions on [this page](ScoreSortCodeAlong.md) to create a simple program in Python that sorts a list of dictionaries to find high scores.

## Sort By Score Challenges
Once the code-along activity has been completed, go to [this page](ScoreSortChallenges.md) to start working on the challenges.

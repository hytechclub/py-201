# Collections in Python
This lesson introduces Lists and Dictionaries in Python. Students should have some understanding of collections, but they may not be familiar with dictionaries. This lesson also includes a look into **sorting algorithms**.

## Warm-up Activity
Complete a warm-up activity to kick off the meeting. This warm-up is designed to introduce the topic for the lesson, and give students some hands-on experience. Groups will briefly present at the end.

1. Provide an overview of the activity
    - Students will work in groups to create a Python program that prints out a playlist
    - Groups will have **15 minutes** to complete the five parts of the activity
    - Groups will have to present at the end of that time
1. Split into breakout rooms, with one instructor per room
1. Share the [instructions](PlaylistWarmup.md) with the students
1. As the students work, monitor their progress
    - Ensure that every student participates
1. When all groups are complete, bring everybody back to the main room
1. Have each group present their work

## PowerPoint Presentation
Present the [Collections](Collections.pptx) PowerPoint Presentation. Review the presentation ahead of time, including the notes in the slides. There are several animations.

## Review Game
Split the group into teams and play the [Baamboozle game](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/303340).

## Code-Along Activity
The [activity](ScoreSortCodeAlong.md) walks through the construction of a sort-by-score application. This should reinforce all of the concepts from the PowerPoint.

## Challenges
The [challenges](ScoreSortChallenges.md) task students with building on the sort-by-score application.

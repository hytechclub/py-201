### Why Learn Python?
If you have learned to code in other languages (like C# or JavaScript), learning Python can enhance your programming skills profoundly. Applying the same concepts in multiple languages will help you reinforce your mastery of those concepts, and make it much easier for you to learn new languages in the future. Python is generally less verbose than a lot of other languages, and there are so many things you can do with very few lines of code. Python is also very popular for industry and personal projects.

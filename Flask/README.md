# Web Server with Flask
This lesson introduces [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and shows how to build a simple web server with it. Students should have some familiarity with HTML structure before the lesson, but all of the necessary code will be provided.

This lesson may move a little quickly, and will not deeply cover many full-stack web development topics. The goal is for students to build pages and work with them; they do not need to understand everything happening with HTTP requests, template rendering, etc.

## Warm-up Activity
This lesson deals with web development. To kick things off, watch the first 45 seconds of [this video](https://youtu.be/mfMrVKnGzwg?t=22) as a class. Then, give the students some time to read through the [Flask Basics](FlaskBasics.md) page. 

## Code-Along Activity
The [activity](FlaskCodeAlong.md) walks through the construction of a web server that provides random jokes. **At the end of the activity, go over the expectations for the challenges: each student will have to present their updated programs at the end of the meeting.**

## Review Activity
Present the [review Quizizz game](https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/6005c1ba7bff8b001d55cbeb/flask-quiz). Try using the "Team Quiz" option to make it a little more fun. The quiz covers material from the code-along activity. Go over any questions that need review. 

## Challenges
The [challenges](FlaskChallenges.md) task students with building on the existing web server. The top priority is the first challenge: students should update the jokes (or quotes) and choose their own. This should not require any new coding, other than changing some text. Every student should be able to achieve this.

## Student Presentations
Toward the end of the meeting, have each student present their websites. They are not required to complete any of the challenges, other than updating the list of random jokes/quotes. The purpose of this is not to test the students or put them on the spot; it is meant to be fun.

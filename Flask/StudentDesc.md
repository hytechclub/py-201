# Web Server with Flask
Learn how to use [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) to build a simple web server in Python.

## Flask Basics Warm-up
Read the overview on [this page](FlaskBasics.md) to become familiar with Flask. Don't worry about fully understanding all of it yet; just try to remember some of the key points.

## Random Joke Code-Along Activity
Follow the instructions on [this page](FlaskCodeAlong.md) to create a website with a page that displays a random joke.

## Flask Challenges
Once the code-along activity has been completed, go to [this page](FlaskChallenges.md) to start working on the challenges. **Note that students will be required to present their websites at the end of the meeting**. It is only expected that you complete the basic challenge (changing the `jokes` list). Beyond that, feel free to do whatever you would like.
